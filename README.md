## üßë‚Äçüíª Learnings

This project was built to practice and solidify key React concepts:

- Setting up a **React project structure** with components and pages
- Passing data and methods via **props** and **Outlet context**
- Managing **global state** (cart items) with `useState`
- Updating nested data immutably (e.g. increasing item quantities)
- Working with **React Router v6** for multipage navigation
- Handling **form inputs** (number inputs, preventing refresh on submit)
- Using **object spread syntax** to update arrays/objects
- Styling with **CSS** and fixing browser quirks (e.g. number input arrows, scrollbars)
- Fetching data asynchronously with **fetch API**
- Writing **tests with React Testing Library**
- Configuring deployment for an SPA
